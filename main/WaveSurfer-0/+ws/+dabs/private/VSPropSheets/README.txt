These prop sheets are intended to be general and shared throughout
Dabs.

What they contain should be largely self-explanatory. They are all
very small propsheets and each serves a specific function. A quick
browse with an XML reader is highly recommended.

LOCAL INSTALL is a "special" propsheet. When it is included in a
project, the developer is expected to modify its user-defined macros
(variables) to configure the build for his/her local machine. Setting
these variables is conceptually equivalent to setting environment
variables to configure a build. Note that these changes to LOCAL
INSTALL should not be checked in.

All the other prop sheets are not intended to be modified during the
course of a regular build. Of course, changes can be submitted if a
bona-fide change to the build conventions is intended.
