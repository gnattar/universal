//% General method for writing digital data to a Task containing one or more digital output Channels
//%% function sampsPerChanWritten = writeDigitalData(task, writeData, timeout, autoStart, numSampsPerChan)
//%   writeData: Data to write to the Channel(s) of this Task. Supplied as matrix, whose columns represent Channels, or sets of Channels.
//%              Data should be of one of types: uint8,uint16,uint32,logical, or double.
//%              In all cases, number of columns of writeData should equal the number of *channels* (not lines) in the task.
//%              (The number of channels, in this context, is equal to the number of times caller called .createDOChan() on the task.)
//%              Data of logical/double type should be such that:
//%                  Number of rows should equal (# lines/Channel) * (number of scans)
//%                  If multiple Channels are present, (# lines/Channel) value corresponds to Channel with largest # lines.
//%              Data of type uint8/16/32 should be such that:
//%                  Number of rows in writeData should equal number of scans (a.k.a. number of samples per channel)
//%                  If Channel in Task is 'port-based', the data type used should contain as many bits as the largest port in the Task.
//%                  If Channel in Task is 'line-based', the data type used should contain as many bits as the largest port that any line in Task belongs to
//%                  If Task contains multiple Channels, then the largest data type required by any Channel must be used for all Channels.
//%                  Note that data for 'line-based' Channels must be arranged in uint8/16/32 value according to the bit/line number 
//%                    (e.g. bit 7 for line 7, even if line 7 is only line in Channel), and NOT by the order/number of lines in the Channel. 
//%                    Bits in the supplied value corresponding to lines not included in Channel are simply ignored.                                      
//%
//%   timeout: <OPTIONAL - Default: inf) Time, in seconds, to wait for function to complete read. If 'inf' or < 0, then function will wait indefinitely. A value of 0 indicates to try once to write the submitted samples. If this function successfully writes all submitted samples, it does not return an error. Otherwise, the function returns a timeout error and returns the number of samples actually written.
//%   autoStart: <OPTIONAL - Logical> Logical value specifies whether or not this function automatically starts the task if you do not start it. 
//%              If empty/omitted, true is assumed when the task is configured for on-demand timing, false is assumed otherwise.
//%   numSampsPerChan: <OPTIONAL> Specifies number of samples per channel to write. If omitted/empty, the number of samples is inferred from number of rows in writeData array. 
//%
//%   sampsPerChanWritten: The actual number of samples per channel successfully written to the buffer.
//%
//%% NOTES
//%   If uint8/16/32 data is supplied, the DAQmxWriteDigitalU8/U16/U32 functions in DAQmx API are used.
//%   If logical/double data is supplied, the DAQmxWriteDigitalLines function in DAQmx API is used. 
//%       (double data is converted to logical type)
//%
//%   The 'dataLayout' parameter of DAQmx API functions is not supported -- data is always grouped by Channel (DAQmx_Val_GroupByChannel).
//%   This corresponds to Matlab matrix ordering where each Channel corresponds to one column. 
//%
//%   Some general rules:
//%       logical/double data is generally supplied for non-buffered write operations, i.e. Tasks for which timing has NOT been configured with a cfgXXXTiming() method.
//%       uint8/16/32 data is recommended (more efficient), but not required, for buffered write operations, i.e. Tasks for which timing has been configured with a cfgXXXTiming() method.
//%   
//%       Generally, logical/double data should only be supplied if Channel(s) in Task are 'line-based', rather than 'port-based'.   
//%       In contrast, uint8/16/32 data is commonly used with either 'port-based' or 'line-based' Channels.
//%
//%       If you configured timing for your task (using a cfgXXXTiming() method), your write is considered a buffered write. The # of samples in the FIRST write call to Task configures the buffer size, unless cfgOutputBuffer() is called first.
//%       Note that a minimum buffer size of 2 samples is required, so a FIRST write operation of only 1 sample (without prior call to cfgOutputBuffer()) will generate an error.
//%
