To bump version
---------------

1.  Change +ws/versionString.m to return the new version.

2.  Add a paragraph to the README about the new release.



To run automated tests
----------------------

To run all tests: Run 'ws.test()'.

All tests are written using Matlab's built in unittest framework.
ws.test() runs all the tests.

If hardware is not present or is not configured, the +nohw packages in
each framework can be run just the tests that do not require an active
hardware connection.

ws.clean() is a utility function related to testing, but not
used by the actual tests.  It clears any persistent information (saved
preferences, etc).  This allows running and testing Wavesurfer in a
"clean" environment.
