Changes in glmlab

From 2.3 to 2.4
* Changes structure of Web Site, and made appropriate changes to
  glmlab to reflect these.
  26 February 1999

* Changed some aspects of Loading Data Files that should make it quicker.
  08 February 1999

* Made startup smoother and quicker.
  05 February 1999

  05 February 1999

* Made minor changes to problems encountered with MATLAB v5.2
  05 February 1999

* Fixed a bug that appeared in MATLAB v5.2 where MATLAB complained about
  problems with a COLON.  Thanx J-MF.
  04 February 1999

* Fixed a problem that appeared in MATLAB v5.2 with loading models.
  This made things better anyway.
  04 February 1999

From 2.2 to 2.3
* Fixed a bug when loading models that sometimes ignored saved information.
  02 November 1998

* Fixed a bug in Saving Models that added a  .glg  extension even
  when it was supplied, despite what the documentation said.
  02 November 1998

* Fixed a bug in  alias  that sometimes meant aliasing of variables
  was reported on an initial fit only when this was not the case.
  02 November 1998

* Fixed some annoying things (not quite bugs) that occurred when the 
  inputs were not quite right; now error messages should be fewer.
  31 August 1998

* Fixed a bug: sometimes FIT MODEL was disabled, and could only
  be enabled by adjusting the y-variable, even when there was no
  problem.
  20 August 1998

* Added some assistance when  glmlab  falls over on startup so that
  the user knows that  dummylog.m  must be in a writeable directory.
  20 August 1998

* Fixed a bug with loading models; the DETAILS file path was 
  hard coded (!).
  20 August 1998

* Fixed a bug in  findvars  that made an appearance in some
  version of  glmlab  (Noticeably Windows version).  Thanx J-MF
  06 August 1998

* Fixed a bug using  findres  that became apparent in log-linear models.
  Thanx Jean-Marc Fromentin.
  30 July 1998

* Fixed a bug in  addpmenu  that made the whole thing freeze
  in some circumstances. 
  29 June 1998

* Made some changes to  glmlab.m, menuwork.m  and  addpmenu  to speed
  glmab up slightly, especially on starting.
  29 June 1998


From 2.0 to 2.2
* Fixed a bug in saving models when the glg extension wasn't given.
  21 April 1998

* Removed  saveseed  and  loadseed  to use the improved  rand.
  19 September 1997

* Fiddled to fix some errors with the plots uimenu.
  05 September 1997

* Added the capacity to save and load models--the workspace
  and settings (in GLMLAB_INFO).
  26 August 1997

* Allowed matrices to be entered into the Covariates window,
  though it is still *strongly* unrecommended.
  26 August 1997

* Added Labels, Gridlines, Marker Attributes and Axis Limits uimenus
  to the residual plots prettying the plots.
  13 August 1997

* A new output display control: toggle the variable information.
  01 August 1997

* A new help window:  OUTPUT VARIABLES
  01 August 1997

* Some tidying of internal workings, including two new files,
  extcrtgl.m  and  resetgl.m.
  01 August 1997

* Now returns the names of the X-variables and the X-matrix as the
  variables XVARNAMES and XMATRIX (thanx to Ross Darnell) and
  separates the parameter estimates (BETA) and their standard errors
  (SERRORS).
  18 July 1997, 02 March 1998


From 1.7 to 2.0 
The changes from version 1.* to 2.* also includes changes for 
running  glmlab  under MATLAB 5.

* Fixed a bug that meant the DETAILS file was a bit odd.  Very odd really.
  8 July 1997

* glmlab  now removes occurences of the same string in the X-variables
  window.
  4 July 1997

* Moved Residuals Plots from being a button to a menu item, and added
  NEW MODEL as a button.
  11 June 1997

* In interactive variable entry, only allowed `double' variables appear in the
  variable list of choices.
  29 May 1997

* Introduced interactive variable entry (apart from interactions...)
  No doubt this will need to be tested more thoroughly.
  28 May 1997

* Changed the X Variable Edit window to accept multi-line strings.
  22 May 1997

* Made some much needed changes to the distributions files in /dist
  15 May 1997

* Added the linear predictor as a returned variable.
  15/05/1997

* Changed  interact.m  to use  varargin  so that the number of interaction
  terms in one interaction is unlimited.
  09/05/1997

* Changed  fhisto.m  so that an error when using some starting points
  caused the x-axis numbering to go wonky.
  07/05/1997

* Altered  fac.m  so that fac-ing a factor with missing levels works OK.
  (ie  fac([1 2 6]) assumes 6 levels, not three as it used to).
  01/05/1997

* Made more room for parameter estimates in output.
  01/05/1997

* Provided error windows for user defined links and distributions when the
  files don't exist.
  01/05/1997

* Provided a separator for user defined links (as for distributions).
  01/05/1997

* Removed an annoyance in DEVLIST that showed the initial condition.
  30/04/1997

* Minor changes to  plotwork  to pretty Inv Gsn and Binoml plots
  30/04/1997

* Moved errors trapping in  glmfit  to a new file,  editerrs.
  28/04/1997

* Altered  lpower  so that zeroes don't cause the log's to fail.
  28/04/1998

* Made some minor changes to  glmlab.m  now that the new on-line manual exists.
  23/04/1997

* glmlab  now remembers the last number entered into the scale parameter
  and power link function input dialogs.
  23/04/1997

* Dimmed the  FIT SPECIFIED MODEL  button when there is no legit model to fit.
  21/04/1997

* Moved some files from one directory to another (some were in some illogical
  places).
  20/04/1997

* Added a demo in the  Help  menu that runs a demo on the  glmlab  screen.
  19/04/1997

* The fitting parameters can now be changed through a dialog box in the
  Options  menu.
  18/04/1997

* Added the inverse Gaussian distribution to its box of tricks.
  17/04/1997

* Fixed a bug that crept in so that changes in deviance and df wasn't displayed.
  17/04/1997

* Fixed the output display that got confused on the first iteration if a power
  link function was used.
  17/04/1997

* Added dialog box exit on a system window close with  CloserequestFcn  to  glmlab.m
  and  glmplot.m
  14/04/1997

* Made a warning status option for turning off the annoying warning messages.
  13/04/1997

* Changed  glmlab.m  so that only one copy of  glmlab  could be run at any
  one time.  A little tricky, and not ideal, but it was difficult (for me
  anyhow) given the  HandleVisibility  property is on  callback.
  12/04/1997

* Changed just about everything and every file to use the UserData property.
  This hides  glmlab's  internal information from the user (so they don't delete
  or clear it accidentally (or otherwise :->) and foul it all up completely).
  11/04/1997

* Changed  HandleVisibility  properties to  callback  in  glmlab.m, 
  glmplot.m  and help windows.
  09/04/1997

* Turned off  RESIDUAL PLOTS...  button after making important structural
  changed to the model.  (A warning still ensues after (possible) variable
  changes, as sometimes the routines are called incidentally.)
  09/04/1997

* Minor wording changes in  glmplot.m.
  09/04/1997

* Some more fine-tuning of the new  fixmeup.m
  09/04/1997

* Minor changes to  opterr.
  09/04/1997

* Some more fixing of  fixmeup  which failed when  glmfit  auto-added
  the transpose character.
  02/04/1997

* Turned the watch off after error messages displayed.
  02/04/1997

* Fixed  rhisto  and  fhisto  to work in MATLAB 5--some minor changes
  (like  XTickLabels  to  XTickLabel and so on).
  26/03/1997

* Distributions for which quantile residuals cannot be found (ie user-
  defined) issues a dialog box warning.
  25/03/1997

* Fixed  glmfit  so that a non-finite dispersion parameter issues a 
  warning, and hides the residuals plots button (since residuals cannot
  be calculated).
  25/03/1997

* Ironically, had to fix up  fixmeup  after the change made below to
  remove the  [  and  ]  that appeared in the variable names.
  25/03/1997

* Fixed up  newmodel  which somehow acquired a bug while including
  the  GLMLAB_INFO_  variable.
  25/03/1997

* When plotting residuals vs covariates, the window asking for the
  covariates doesn't pop up when there is only one covariate--it
  just uses it.  (This behaviour was already part of the last version;
  the recent fiddling, however, failed to do this.)
  24/03/1997

* Changed the plotting window so that Transformed Residual are no
  longer an option when using the normal distribution (there is no
  transformation is that case).
  24/03/1997

* glmlab  now reports an error when trying to fit a model with no
  co-variates and no constant term.  (It used to shrug, and decide to
  fit a constant term anyway).
  24/03/1997

* Used cells to hide most of the internal  glmlab  variables (like the
  error function, link, etc...) but stashing them in the UserData
  variable  GLMLAB_INFO_, making  who  and  whos  much cleaner (which is
  great, of course, when trying to see what vars are loaded).
  24/03/1997

* Made sure the Residual plots didn't have plots ending up on the axis and
  hence sometimes obscured.
  23/03/1997

* Fixed a bug in residual plotting that only plotted the first replicate
  of residuals in a quantile equivalents plot.
  23/03/1997

* Added a dialog box to indicate that files have been successfully loaded.
  23/03/1997

* When a binomial dist is specified but the response variable
  is not set up for it, glmlab would use the binomial, but not check
  the binomial dist and logit link in the uimenus (though they were
  permanently set).  Likewise when a non-binomial is specified but the
  response is set for binomial.  Now, a dialog box appears indicating
  the change, and the new distributions and links are checked.
  22/03/1997

* Fixed some bugs in the residual plotting when the binomial
  distribution is used.
  22/03/1997

* Errors appearing in  opterr  now appear in dialog boxes.
  22/03/1997

* The variables when entered no longer appear with  [  and  ]  enclosing.
  Was a dumb idea to begin with really...
  22/03/1997

* When the input variables are different lengths, dialog boxes now
  show the error message.
  22/03/1997

* On asking for a new model, a dialog box appears giving the user a chance
  to bail out.
  22/03/1997

* Fiddled with the pushbuttons on the main  glmlab  window, adding a CLOSE
  button (so it looks a bit more like other windows), and hence needing to
  shift and re-size the FIT and RESIDUALS buttons.
  22/03/1997

* Added a question dialog box so that the user can bail out after electing
  to quit and lose settings.
  22/03/1997

* Added a plot to the RESIDUALS PLOTS menu--fitted values without the
  constant information transformation.
  21/03/1997

* Changed  npplot  so that the legend didn't obscure the title (this only
  occurred with MATLAB 5 for some reason).
  21/03/1997

* Changed the plotting routine so that it asks nicely for which
  covariates to plot against residuals, rather than guessing from the
  first five observations.
  21/03/1997

* Fixed minors bug in plotting routine: always labelled the
  covariates as  Covariate(1)  whatever the number should have been (hmm....);
  fixed a bug that crept in when randomised quantile residuals were calculated
  (replicates were not asked for).
  20/03/1997

* Re-ordered res vs covar plot so that the replicates were repeated first 
  before the covariate.
  20/03/1997

* Fixed a minor bug in plotting:  Residual vs Response when y~Binomial would plot
  twice--once for observed counts and once for sample size.  Now plots the ratio,
  and is labelled accordingly.
  20/03/1997

* Changed things (I hope!) to be MATLAB 5 complaint.
  19/03/1997

* Now the power link function shows the power used (don't know why
  it took so long...!)
  19/03/1997

* Added access to on-line manual from help menu, and to MathWorks and
  glmlab  Web pages from appropriate help windows.
  19/03/1997

* Made some of the help windows smaller and better using  textwrap.
  19/03/1997

* Placed help and demo files in their own directory:  glmhelp
  19/03/1997

* Changed/added dialog boxes using  MATLAB 5 capabilities.
  18/03/1997


From 1.6 to 1.7

* Changed the way  paramtrs  handles the parameter values.
  Now, the current values are written to a file named  PARAVALS.mat
  and stored in the top directory.  This now allows the user to 
  more easily change parameters on the run without editting the 
  parametrs.m file.
  06/02/1996

* Changed the  plot  directory to  plotting  to stop the double-up with
  the MATLAB function by the same name (made  help plot  ugly, and besides,
  it was a stupid thing to do in the first place).

* glmlab now tells you that it's thinking by printing dots on the screen
  as different routines and loops are called.

* Made some minor changes to some files for efficiency.


From 1.5 to 1.6

* Problems with  interact.m  were dealt with.  The algorithm now
  also handles interactions of up to 12 variables (though a small
  changes to the function line changes it to more if needed).
  Thanx to Janek ....

* Added accelerators to some menu items.

* Deleted a lot of files not used any more.

* Made some functions more efficient.
 

------

Some broad changes to earlier versions:

From 1.3 to 1.4
* Some changes to the files for efficiency reasons.
* Also cleaned up the interface a little more.

From 1.2 to 1.3
* Changed the graphical user interface to use pull-down menus.
  This cleaned up the interface, and made it less cluttered.

From 1.1 to 1.2
* Changed the command line interface to a graphical user interface.
  Each option (distribution, link, ...) has a button to press 
  giving options from which to choose.

From 1.0 to 1.1
* Changed the GLIM-like command line interface to a prompted 
  command line interface.
