function answ=dinv_gsn(what,y,mu,m,weights)
%DINV_GSN The distribution information for the inverse Gaussian distribution.
%USE:  answ=dinv_gsn(what,y,mu,m,weights)
%   where  y,  mu,  m and  weights  are the obvious;
%          what  returns what is asked:
%             what== 1 returns the variance function;
%             what== 2 returns the deviance/scaled deviance;
%          answ  is the answer asked for.
%Called by  irls, glmfit.
