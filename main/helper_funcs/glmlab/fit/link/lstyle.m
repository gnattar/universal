function answ=lstyle(input1,input2,what)
%LSTYLE A template for user-defined link functions in glmlab.
%USE:  answ=lstyle(input1,input2,what)
%   where  input1 and input2 are inputs depending on what is wanted (see below);
%          what  returns what is asked:
%             what== 'eta' returns the eta, the linear predictor;
%             what== 'mu' returns mu, the fitted values;
%             what== 'detadmu', returns the derivative d(eta)/d(mu);
%          answ  is the answer asked for.
%Called by  irls, glmfit.

%  input2 is only used for binomial (logit/complg) cases, when  input2=m.
%  for finding eta,           input1 = mu
%  for finding mu,            input1 = eta
%  for finding d(eta)/d(mu),  input1 = mu
